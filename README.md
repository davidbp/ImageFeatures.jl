# ImageFeatures Port to 0.7

Objectives:

- Port the code to 0.7 and 1.0.
- Make all current notebooks 100% reproducible.
- Improve performance.  
   - Allow HOG to be computed as a matrix. Get patches from that matrix instead of patches from the original image and compute the HOG descriptor for each patch.
